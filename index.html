<div class="intro"> <p>Hello, my name is Rudy. I am the father of a 9 year old boy named Ethan.
  I thought having a son would give me the opportunity to teach him something about the world. Pass on my knowledge
  so to speak. But throughout the years I’ve realized something. It’s been the other way around. He has passed on
  his knowledge to me instead. The reason for this is obvious. In many ways he's smarter than me. I may have a Master's degree.
  I may know certain things that he doesn’t through sheer exposure to circumstances or by being in situations
  that he hasn’t encountered before. But the reality is, he percieves the world in ways I never did when I was his age.
  And all throughout this, he's been a complete smartass, a constant pain
  and has never missed an opportunity to get on my nerves.</p>

  <p>I’ve started compiling real-life conversations that we have had over the years.
  This website is a small collection of <em>some</em> of these conversations. They have not been altered,
  exaggerated or fabricated in any way. I don’t claim to be “Father Of The Year” or Bill Cosby.
  But considering what we know about Bill Cosby, that’s probably not a bad thing.
  I'd compare us more to the family from  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_Standing_(TV_series)">"Still Standing"</a>.</p></div>

  <div id="dedication">I dedicate this site to Ethan.<br>
  <b>I love you, son.</b></div>
