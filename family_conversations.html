  <div class="setting"> <p> My wife Marianna moved to the U.S. over 19 years ago. She is originally from Azerbaijan,
  a former Soviet Country located in the South Caucasus between Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe.
  It is bordered by Russia, Armenia, Georgia, Iran, and Turkey.<br>
  If you ever have the opportunity to visit Azerbaijan…..don’t.</p></div>

  Did you know there are people still alive today who were born in the 1800's?
  <div class="pic"> <img src="images/marianna.jpg" alt="marianna"/></div>
  In 1800's? What? They are 115 years old?!
  <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_smartass.jpg" alt="rudy_smartass"/></div>
  Yeah. I just read about it. Two women. Oldest in the world. 115 years old. One from Italy. One from Brooklyn.
  <div class="pic"> <img src="images/marianna.jpg" alt="marianna"/></div>
  Wonder what she eats.
  <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_laugh.jpg" alt="rudy_laugh"/></div>
  Anything she wants. Pretty unhealthy. Long lived due to genetics mostly.>
  <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_authority.jpg" alt="rudy_authority"/></div>
  You know, it's crazy. 115 years old. Born in 1899. Imagine that. When she was alive, she saw the first automobile.
  There were no cars! No modern medicine or antibiotics. Electricity, even though it already existed was a luxury.
  It was a commodity that very few people had at that time! Can you imagine that?
  <div class="pic"> <img src="images/marianna.jpg" alt="marianna"/></div>
  I don't have to. I lived it. Sounds like Azerbaijan early to mid 90's.

     Daddy, what does it mean when someone blushes?
     <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy.jpg" alt=""/></div>
     It means either that person is shy or having a stroke.
     <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan.jpg" alt="ethan"/></div>
     Molly from first grade said hi to me but then started blushing.
    <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy.jpg" alt="rudy"/></div>
     Well, there you have it. She obviously suffered a stroke.
     <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_sad.jpg" alt="ethan_sad"/></div>
      Oh......
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_authority.jpg" alt="ethan_authority"/></div>
      I heard somewhere that it may also mean that someone may be in love with you.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_question.jpg" alt="rudy_question"/></div>
        Really? Huh. I'm in love with your mom and I never blush when I talk to her.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_smartass.jpg" alt="rudy_smartass"/></div>
          However, your mom blushes when she talks to me. So that must mean she's really in love with me.<br>
          I could even see her face turn red.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_authority.jpg" alt="rudy_authority"/></div>
          Come to think of it, she's always yelling at me when it happens.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_question.jpg" alt="rudy_question"/></div>
         So anyway, you like this girl?
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_shout.jpg" alt="ethan_shout"/></div>
          NO!
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_happy.jpg" alt="rudy_happy"/></div>
        Nothing wrong with it if you want to date her.
        <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan.jpg" alt="ethan"/></div>
        No. She's in 1st grade. I'm in 3rd. She's too young for me.
        <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_smartass.jpg" alt="rudy_smartass"/></div>
            You hang out with that kid in kindergarten.
        <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_authority.jpg" alt="ethan_authority"/></div>
              Dad. That's different. I'm friends with that boy.

          So you'll hang out with some dude in kindergarten but you won't hook up with a girl from 1st grade?<br>
          What's wrong with you?
         <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan.jpg" alt="ethan"/></div>
          Dad, let it go! I just wanted to know about what blushing means. She was blushing when she started talking to me.
          <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy.jpg" alt="rudy"/></div>
          Well, there you have it. She must have had a stroke.
          <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_question.jpg" alt="ethan_question"/></div>
          Are you sure she's not in love with me?
          <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy.jpg" alt="rudy"/></div>
          I’m quite certain. It’s a stroke. But if you want to, you can ask your mom.<br>
          I'm no good at this parental advice stuff.
          <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_facepalm.jpg" alt="ethan_facepalm"/></div>

                    So Ethan, I hope I was able to help you with your homework today. Subtracting is easy.<br>
                    It’s really just adding in reverse. It’s ok to use your fingers if you need to as a shortcut. See? It’s easy.<br>
                    I do that too. I still use my fingers sometimes and I’m a grown up. Nothing wrong with that if it helps. Now run along now.

                    Ethan, you're no longer using your fingers? You are subtracting and even adding numbers in your head?
                    <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan.jpg" alt="ethan"/></div>
                    That's right.

                    You are so smart! I'm so proud of you, son.<br>

      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_authority.jpg" alt="ethan_authority"/></div>
      No. Like use security cameras. We can place them everywhere there are people. Then the gov’t can keep track of where everybody is.<br>
      If someone is doing something they shouldn’t, the police will come right away and take them to jail. <br>

      Dad, I have a question. <br>
      What if a president makes a promise and then doesn’t keep his promise? Is it illlegal?
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_laugh.jpg" alt="rudy_laugh"/></div>
      hahaha. No. If that was illegal, every president would be in jail.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_question.jpg" alt="ethan_question"/></div>
      Why is it not illegal?
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy.jpg" alt="rudy"/></div>
      Ethan, all presidents break promises. They’re politicians. They all lie to some degree.<br>
      They make promises and don’t always keep them. But no. Technically, it’s not illegal.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_authority.jpg" alt="ethan_authority"/></div>
      We should IMPEACH!
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_laugh.jpg" alt="rudy_laugh"/></div>
      You can’t impeach just because a president lies.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_smartass.jpg" alt="rudy_smartass"/></div>
      Unless he lies about oral... uh nevermind..
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_angry.jpg" alt="ethan_angry"/></div>
      Well, then we should do something about it.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy.jpg" alt="rudy"/></div>
      Ok. What do you want to do about it?
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_shout.jpg" alt="ethan_shout"/></div>
      Something! We can’t let them get away with this! I know what we can do.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_question.jpg" alt="ethan_question"/></div>
      You know what? I have an idea.<br>
      Maybe next time when presidents become presidents they should stay as presidents until they die.<br>
      And when they die, we just have a small group of people select another president to automatically take over by birth.<br>
      Don’t they have something like that?

      Yes. At least at the beginning you could have lied and told me that Santa was real.

      Mom and I wanted to be honest with you so that you'd be a critical thinker and not grow up stupid.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan.jpg" alt="ethan"/></div>
      Yeah, well you could have at least lied about Santa at the beginning and let me believe what I wanted to believe.<br>
      I could have believed in magic and Santa. Then things would be fun. Now holidays are boring because I know the truth.<br>
      You could have told me later when I got older. Maybe when I was 13 or something.

      Hey Ethan, you know what? <br>
      Last night, I was researching something online and it turns out Santa is actually real!
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan.jpg" alt="ethan"/></div>
      No way.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy.jpg" alt="rudy"/></div>
      Yeah. I guess I was wrong all along. I looked it up.<br>
      I originally thought he wasn't real, but it turns out he IS real!
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_smartass.jpg" alt="rudy_smartass"/></div>
      The reason he wasn't coming to your house on Christmas is because we had to register your name with the office of Santa commission online at the North Pole.<br>
      That way, he would know where you live. It’s a very convoluted bureaucratic process these days.<br>
      But I registered you so Santa now knows where you live.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_happy.jpg" alt="rudy_happy"/></div>
      So you see? He is real after all. So let’s just go about our day and…
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan.jpg" alt="ethan"/></div>
      .....how does he travel?
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_question.jpg" alt="rudy_question"/></div>
      Um.. well he uses technology. You see, the reindeer have rockets attached to them so it lets him fly.<br>
      Ok? Cool. We’ve established that he is real.<br>
      So let’s just change the topic.<br>
      You know, an interesting thing happened to me when I was….
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_angry.jpg" alt="ethan_angry"/></div>
      Nobody can live that long. It's biologically impossible. I know that.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_authority.jpg" alt="ethan_authority"/></div>
      Uh...right. Well...when Santa gets too old, his son takes over the business and he becomes the new Santa. <br>
      So Santa IS real. Now let's stop talking about it.<br>
      So anyway, I was…
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_question.jpg" alt="ethan_question"/></div>
      What if Santa stops having children? It's been many years.<br>
      One of his sons may not be able to have children. Then what?<br>
      And how can he fly to everyone in one night? It’s not logical.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_angry.jpg" alt="rudy_angry"/></div>
      He works it out. He gets help.

      I want evidence.

      Well, he will come to your house on Christmas eve.<br>
      You just have to leave milk and cookies for him overnight.

      Um…it turns out Santa actually likes the same cookies that I do.<br>
      So make sure you leave the same kind of cookies or he won't come.<br>
      He's kind of a prick about these things. So if you don't bribe him he never shows up.

      .....hmmmmm
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan.jpg" alt="ethan"/></div>
      I want proof that he is there.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/rudy_smartass.jpg" alt="rudy_smartass"/></div>
      Well he will show up at night.
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_authority.jpg" alt="ethan_authority"/></div>
      I'll check the closet for a Santa suit to make sure you didn't dress up as Santa.<br>
      We'll also check our security cameras in the living room to obtain evidence that Santa was there.<br>
      If he really exists, we should have evidence of him.

      sigh.... Ethan, don't you just want to believe that Santa is real?
      <div class="pic"> <img src="images/ethan_shout.jpg" alt="ethan_shout"/></div>
      Yes. Of course I do. But I don't want to be stupid.<br>
      You already changed my viewpoint to be a critical thinker.<br>
      I can't help it anymore!
